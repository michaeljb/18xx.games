- make Game use the Tree instead of its actions array
    - current action id --> trunk/canonical head

- add basic visualization

    - `child` relations could have solid line, other `children` get dashed?

    - colors for different states
        - premoves
        - broken actions
        - current head
        - "change history" branches


- URL param head=, history navigation on undone branches
    - different head given to ActionTree::Tree

- more tests
